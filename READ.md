# Getting Started with data pipeline

To get started, we'll build consolidation algorithm for accumulating data from partners and choose a name for the accomodation based on the priority list.


## Prerequisites

You'll need the following:
* [Python]

## Possible objectives

In order to avoid data complexity and data management a better selection process or algorithm is needed for a company.

The better the solution is, better is the automized process and less effort involved for its pipeline orchastration.


## 1. Clone the sample app

you can clone the project from [Git repo].
   ```

  ```

## 2. Run the app locally

First, you have to install the dependencies listed in the [requirements.txt]to run it locally.

I prefer using a virtual environment [virtual environment] to avoid my dependencies clash with those of my other Python projects.
  ```
pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

Run the app.
  ```
python consolidator.py
  ```

## 3. See the image and Pipelinedesign documents for reference of the whole process.
